\section{Pressure and molar density}

\subsection*{Challenge}
Given that the saturation pressure of water in air at a given temperature is \SI{0.05}{\bar} with a saturated molar density of \SI{5}{\kmol\per\cubic\meter}, if the partial pressure of water in the air is \SI{0.01}{\bar}, calculate the molar density of the water in the air.

\section{Specific volume}

\subsection*{Challenge}
Referring to the specific volume of saturated water at 290 K in table A-6 ($v_g$), what is the saturated molar concentration? You cannot assume this is an ideal gas.

\subsection*{Solution}
\SI{7.97e-4}{\kmol\per\cubic\meter}

\section{Molar density of air}

\subsection*{Challenge}
Assuming air to be an ideal gas, calculate the molar density of air, $C_{air}$ at 300 K and atmospheric pressure.

\subsection*{Solution}
\SI{4.1e-2}{\kmol\per\cubic\meter}
